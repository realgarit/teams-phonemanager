# Accepted Avalonia compatibility limit

Operator decision: 2026-10-12. Tracking record:
https://github.com/realgarit/phonedesk/issues/203

Avalonia 11 is the supported application stack. PackageReference ranges have an
exclusive 12.0.0 upper bound, so a transitive dependency cannot silently select
Avalonia 12. Dependabot excludes the incompatible framework and theme versions;
compatible patches remain eligible for review.

The proposed icons 1.3.316 targets pre-0.11 Avalonia, while icons 2.1.344 requires Avalonia 12. Keep icons exactly 1.1.223 and FluentAvaloniaUI below 3. The Avalonia 12 proposal also fails on removed clipboard and obsolete placeholder APIs.

Reopen the record for a deliberate migration that aligns the framework, theme,
icons and test packages, replaces removed APIs, passes clean builds and tests,
and verifies representative native UI behavior. Remove the limits together in
that migration PR. This closes the queue item as an accepted limit rather than
claiming Avalonia 12 support.
